      <h2> Who are we? </h2>
      <p> This website was created by five Drexel University students — Kamola, Jenniyah, Maiesha, Jojo, and Ashvi — as a group project for their INFO 151 class. As women working together in a traditionally male-dominated field, we’re proud to bring our creativity, technical skills, and passion for Philadelphia into a platform designed to help others explore the city with ease.</p>
